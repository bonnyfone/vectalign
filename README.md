# VectAlign [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/bonnyfone/maven/org.bonnyfone.vectalign/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/bonnyfone/maven/vectalign-0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar) [![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-VectAlign-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://android-arsenal.com/details/1/2443)

**VectAlign** (a.k.a. *VectorDrawableAlign*) is a developer's tool which automagically **aligns two `VectorDrawable` "pathData" strings (or SVG images) in order to allow morphing animations** between them using an `AnimatedVectorDrawable`. VectAlign can be used from command line or through a simple GUI (which includes *morphing preview* and *export* functionalities).

Here are some examples of what you can do with the help of VectAlign (take a look at the [sample project] for a live demo):

 The problem
--

As stated in the [official docs] two paths must be *compatible* so that they can be morphed, which means that the **paths must be composed by the same list of SVG commands** (in terms of length and type of commands). 

Example of **compatible paths**: 
```a
M 10,10 L 40,10 L 40,40 L 10,40 Z
M 25,10 L 40,25 L 25,40 L 10,25 Z
```

Example of **incompatible paths**: 
```
M 10,10 L 40,10 L 40,40 L 10,40 Z
M 30,30 L 10,10 C 14,25 20,30 10,49 L 3,3 L 0,8 Z
```

Creating an `AnimatedVectorDrawable` containing morphing animations which use *incompatible* paths leads to runtime exceptions like the following:

```
android.view.InflateException: Binary XML file line #3 Can't morph from M 10,10 L 40,10 L 40,40 L 10,40 Z  to  M 30,30 L 10,10 C 14,25 20,30 10,49 L 3,3 L 0,8 Z
        at android.animation.AnimatorInflater.setupAnimatorForPath(AnimatorInflater.java:337)
        at android.animation.AnimatorInflater.parseAnimatorFromTypeArray(AnimatorInflater.java:283)
...
```
When the morphing involves only simple shapes is averagely simple to fix the paths by manually injecting or duplicating commands here and there; but when the complexity of the shapes grows, this task becomes quite tedious to do by hand (sometimes almost impossible). 
**VectAlign automagically aligns any pair of SVG paths (regardless of their complexity), creating a new pair of morphable paths without altering the original images.**


 Download
--
You can download the latest version of the pre-compiled jar from **[here]**.

 Changelog
--
 - **v0.2** 
  - added different morphing strategies (BASE, LINEAR, SUB\_BASE, SUB\_LINEAR)
  - added GUI (view, load and edit SVG/pathData, *morphing preview*)
  - added *export* function (automatically creates all the Android XML resources required)
 
 - **v0.1** 
  - first public release of VectAlign (command line only)

 Usage
--
Run VectAlign from command line by passing the two paths that you want to use in your morphing animation; you can pass these sequences by typing them directly or by referring a file (a simple txt file or even a standard SVG image); simply pass no params if you want to start the GUI:

**Examples of execution**

Run VectAlign in GUI mode:
```bash
java -jar  vectalign.jar 
```
```bash
java -jar  vectalign.jar --gui
```

Run VectAlign in command line mode:

```bash
java -jar  vectalign.jar   --start "M 10,20..."   --end "M 30,30..."
```
```bash
java -jar  vectalign.jar   --start image1.svg   --end image2.svg
```

The result represents the aligned (and *compatible*) version of the input paths/images: these new paths can be finally morphed using an `AnimatedVectorDrawable` without incurring in the *"Can't morph from X to Y"* exceptions:

**Example of output**
```bash
--------------------
  ALIGNMENT RESULT  
-------------------- 
# new START sequence:  
M 48.0,54.0 L 31.0,42.0 L 15.0,54.0 L 21.0,35.0 L 6.0,23.0 L 25.0,23.0 L 25.0,23.0 L 25.0,23.0 L 25.0,23.0 L 32.0,4.0 L 40.0,23.0 L 58.0,23.0 L 42.0,35.0 L 48.0,54.0 

# new END sequence:  
M 48.0,54.0 L 48.0,54.0 L 48.0,54.0 L 48.0,54.0 L 31.0,54.0 L 15.0,54.0 L 10.0,35.0 L 6.0,23.0 L 25.0,10.0 L 32.0,4.0 L 40.0,10.0 L 58.0,23.0 L 54.0,35.0 L 48.0,54.0 

```

**Available options**

```bash

                                               SVG file)
 -e,--end <"string"|txt_file|svg_file>         Ending VectorDrawable path
                                               ("string", txt file or SVG

How it works
--
VectAlign is based on an adaptation of the [Needleman-Wunsch] algorithm, which is used in bioinformatics to align protein or nucleotide sequences. 


Notes and known issues
--
 - This is an experimental tool which faces a complex task. **Result's quality may vary depending on the inputs**; thus, *wow effect* of the resulting animation is not guaranteed.
 - Aligning complex shapes **may create visual artifacts on one or both images**; in this case, try to simplify the original SVG path (e.g. using [InkScape]) and then run VectAlign again (see also the *Tips* section).
 - When referring a SVG file, all the path groups which compose the image will be merged in one single path.
 - If your SVG path is too much complex the system renderer will throw a silent exception: "*OpenGLRendererï¹• Path too large to be rendered into a texture*"; in this case you need to simplify your image further.


Tips
--
 - When morphing complex aligned paths, for best result **avoid using the `fillColor` attribute  in your `VectorDrawable` and use the `strokeColor` only**. This because filled surfaces are more likely to be affected by artifacts than the stroke-only ones and usually provide less gorgeous morphing effects.
 - As general rule, *similar* images (in terms of SVG complexity) morph better than very different ones.
 - If you don't like the result of a morphing, try to alter the original images by simplifying the SVG path (e.g. using [InkScape]) and then run VectAlign again.
 - Since *AnimatedVectorDrawable* is API 21+ you can use the [vector-compat] library to extend support down to API 14+.
